# CV Maker
Design which I am currently using to generate my CV. <br>
Logic for exporting CV to PDF is implemented using Node.js libraries. <br>
Data is static, but I am currently working on making it dynamic. <br>
My goal is to deploy that project and make it available for everyone to make their own CVs with great designs for free. <br>
